# Admin Application Database Migration - Complete

## ✅ Migration Complete

The admin application has been **completely converted** from dummy/hard-coded data to a fully **database-driven system** using real Supabase database connections.

## 🔄 What Was Changed

### 🗃️ Database Service Layer

- **Created**: `lib/database.ts` - Comprehensive database service with all data operations
- **Implements**: Real-time data fetching for all admin functions
- **Handles**: Error handling, loading states, and proper data formatting

### 📊 Dashboard (Complete Rewrite)

- **Real Statistics**: Live counts from database tables
- **Dynamic Activities**: Real-time recent bookings, payments, grievances
- **Live Alerts**: Actual maintenance alerts, overdue payments
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculated from real data
- **Role-based Data**: Filtered based on admin user permissions

### 🚍 Management Pages (All Database-Driven)

1. **Routes Page**

   - Live route data with real occupancy
   - Driver and vehicle assignments from database
   - Real route stops and capacity information

2. **Students Page**

   - Complete student records with transport profiles
   - Real payment status and outstanding amounts
   - Department and program information from database

3. **Drivers Page**

   - Live driver records with experience and ratings
   - Real contact information and status
   - Trip counts and performance metrics

4. **Vehicles Page**
   - Real vehicle fleet data with maintenance tracking
   - Live insurance and fitness expiry dates
   - Actual fuel consumption and capacity data

### 🗑️ Removed Dummy Data

- **Deleted**: `data/admin-data.ts` (608 lines of dummy data)
- **Deleted**: `data/users.ts` (hard-coded user data)
- **Removed**: All import statements referencing dummy data
- **Cleaned**: Hard-coded statistics and sample activities

### 🔧 Database Functions Implemented

```typescript
// Dashboard & Analytics
- getDashboardStats(): Live counts and metrics
- getRecentActivities(): Real-time activity feed
- getCriticalAlerts(): Maintenance and payment alerts
- getPerformanceMetrics(): Calculated KPIs

// Core Data Operations
- getRoutes(): Route management with stops
- getStudents(): Student records with transport profiles
- getDrivers(): Driver management with performance data
- getVehicles(): Fleet management with maintenance tracking
- getBookings(): Booking history and status
- getPayments(): Payment records and status
- getNotifications(): System notifications
- getGrievances(): Issue tracking and resolution
```
