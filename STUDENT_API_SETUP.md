# Student API Setup Guide

## Current Status âœ… CONNECTED TO REAL API

The student fetching functionality is now integrated and connected to your real API at:
**`https://myadmin.jkkn.ac.in/api/api-management/`**

## API Integration Files Created

1. **`/app/api/api-management/students/route.ts`** - Handles student search/list API calls
2. **`/app/api/api-management/students/[id]/route.ts`** - Handles individual student details API calls
3. **UI Components** - Badge, Select, and Separator components for the student interface

## Real API Connection âœ…

The system is now connected to your real API:

- **Base URL**: `https://myadmin.jkkn.ac.in/api/api-management/`
- **API Key**: `jk_21372a6d0f4ca05d02139a0fb714a2e5_mcejx5qz`
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `GET /students?search={email}` - Search students by email
  - `GET /students/{id}` - Get detailed student information

## How to Test

1. **Navigate to the Students page** in your admin panel

4. Fetches detailed info: `GET /students/{student_id}`
5. Displays comprehensive student profile
