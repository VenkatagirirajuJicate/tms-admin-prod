## ⚡ **CRITICAL CORRECTIONS NEEDED - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 1. **Missing CRUD Operations** (Immediate)

```typescript
// ❌ MISSING - Must implement immediately
DatabaseService.deleteRoute(routeId: string)
DatabaseService.deleteDriver(driverId: string) 
DatabaseService.deleteVehicle(vehicleId: string)
DatabaseService.updateVehicle(vehicleId: string, vehicleData: any)
DatabaseService.deleteStudent(studentId: string)
```

### 2. **Database Relationship Fixes** (This Week)

```sql
-- Fix route queries to include relationships
SELECT r.*, 
       COUNT(rs.id) as stop_count,
       d.name as driver_name,
       v.registration_number
FROM routes r
LEFT JOIN route_stops rs ON r.id = rs.route_id
LEFT JOIN drivers d ON r.driver_id = d.id
LEFT JOIN vehicles v ON r.vehicle_id = v.id
GROUP BY r.id, d.name, v.registration_number;
```

### 3. **Validation Enhancements** (This Week)

```typescript
// GPS coordinates validation
const validateCoordinates = (lat: string, lng: string) => {
  const latitude = parseFloat(lat);
  const longitude = parseFloat(lng);
  
  if (isNaN(latitude) || latitude < -90 || latitude > 90) {
    return false;
  }
  if (isNaN(longitude) || longitude < -180 || longitude > 180) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
};

// Stop time sequence validation
const validateStopTimes = (stops: Stop[], departureTime: string, arrivalTime: string) => {
  // Ensure stops are in chronological order
  // Ensure first stop is after departure time
  // Ensure last stop is before arrival time
};
```

### 4. **Component Integration Fixes** (This Week)

- Connect vehicle edit modal to database operations
- Fix route stop counting in UI cards
- Add proper error handling across all modals
- Implement assignment conflict validation

---

## 🏗️ **DATABASE SCHEMA CORRECTIONS**

### **Required Migrations:**

1. **Add unique constraints:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE routes ADD CONSTRAINT unique_route_number UNIQUE (route_number);
```

2. **Add coordinate validation:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE routes ADD CONSTRAINT valid_coordinates 
CHECK (
  (start_latitude IS NULL OR (start_latitude >= -90 AND start_latitude <= 90)) AND
  (start_longitude IS NULL OR (start_longitude >= -180 AND start_longitude <= 180))
);
```

3. **Add cascade deletes:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE route_stops DROP CONSTRAINT route_stops_route_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE route_stops ADD CONSTRAINT route_stops_route_id_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY (route_id) REFERENCES routes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

4. **Fix column name inconsistencies:**
```sql
-- Standardize driver table columns
-- Standardize vehicle table columns
-- Update all related queries
```
